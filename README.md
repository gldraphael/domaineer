# domaineer

`domaineer` is a web application that allows you to check if your desired domain name is available. 

## Why `domaineer`?

* **No front running:** `domaineer` does not register or "taste" domains based on searches.
* **Privacy first:** `domaineer` does not track or log your searches. `domaineer` does not share search information with 3rd parties.
* **Open source:** `domaineer` is fully open source.

## Self-hosting

You are encouraged to host `domaineer` on your own servers. 

A docker image is available on GitHub Container Registry [here][ghcr].
Helm chart support is planned.

If you need any assistance self-hosting this project, please open an issue.

## License

TBD.
